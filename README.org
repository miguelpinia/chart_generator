* How to install dependencies and run the code

This repository use virtualenv as a way to provide project isolation respect to
the system. The python's version that I use for develop this was =python 3.9.7=,
but should it works with any superior version. To install dependencies and
enable virtualenv, execute the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m venv ./.venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src
